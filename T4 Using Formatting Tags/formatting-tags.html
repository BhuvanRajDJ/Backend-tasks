    <p><b>Regardless of age, culture or sex,</b> <i>we exist in organic bodies that constantly move.</i></p>
    <p>
    There is a notable <u>perception gap</u> in the arts since still poses that aesthetically suggest motion are commonly used as a replacement for actual body movement. </p>

    Many years of figurative art studies taught me that there is a <s>common observable</s> phenomenon—it is unnatural for the human body to pose motionless for extended periods of time.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Models</b> suffer from <i>fatigue</i> due to the <u>overuse</u> of certain muscles to maintain a pose. This realization confounded me. I wanted to create work that reflected a total balance and respect for the <s>model’s body </s> and my own artistic expression. Consequently, I decided to capture body movement.</p>
